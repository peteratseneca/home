#### Student advisor

I'm a busy guy. Depending on the situation, our program's student advisor may be able to help you, if I am not available or am slow to reply to a contact attempt:

Carol Ann David  

She has some drop-in availability every day, and can be contacted by email at carolann.david -at- senecacollege.ca.
