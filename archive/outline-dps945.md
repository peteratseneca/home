### Evaluation

Assessment / evaluation | Value
--- | ---
Midterm tests | 20% 
Web API programming assignment, individual | 10%
Web API programming assignment, group/team | 10%
App programming assignment, group/team | 40%
Presentation | 20%

In the last week of the course, the student will present their app programming assignment work to the professor, invited members, and perhaps interested external parties. 

This course does not have a final examination. 

This course includes group/team work, and these are the initial guidelines and procedures:
*	A team has approximately 4 or 5 students. 
*	The team will be selected by the professor and would be announced by the first class.
