### Course name

Mobile App Development - Cross-Platform

### Course description

This course covers the foundations of programming applications for mobile devices, with widely-used cross-platform developer kits. In contrast to platform-specific developer kits, a cross-platform kit enables a single code base to be compatible with the most-used mobile device platforms. Students will write their apps by using one or more leading cross-platform kits. A wide range of mobile app development topics, including user interface programming techniques, data management, and network access will be covered.

### Learning outcomes

Upon successful completion of this subject the student will be able to:
1. Create cross platform apps for multiple environments.
1. Compare cross-platform and platform-specific app development approaches. 
1. Build, install, develop, test and deploy multi-page apps. 
1. Store and retrieve data from a variety of sources. 
1. Develop/design cross-platform user interfaces that will ensure rich user experience.

We need one or two more for the degree version of the course. 

### Employability skills

DPS926 only (to be provided) 

### Topic outline

In the current version of the course, the student will work with two cross-platform developer kits:
* Xamarin 
* Ionic 

First half of the course (Xamarin development)
1.	Guided Tour to C#
1.	Getting Started - Create Your First Application
1.	Forms Application and Layouts
1.	User Interface
1.	Database
1.	Web Services

Second half of the course (Ionic development)
1.	Getting Started â€“ Installation, Develop and Deploy First App
1.	Angular review 
1.	Layout and Theming
1.	UI Components
1.	Data Storage
1.	Authentication

### Prescribed text(s)

None

### Reference material

Course topics will be guided by the course's web site content, which is provided by the professor, the cross-platform developer resources, and trusted and authoritative third-party resources. 

### Supplies

Student should use their own computer to do development work, as the College systems do not currently support all aspects of Xamarin and Ionic development. 

Student should also have their own mobile device to use as a deployment target. 

### Promotion policy

To obtain a credit in this subject, a student must:
* Pass the weighted average of all tests.
* Pass the weighted average of all assignments.
* (proposed) Successfully complete all of the assignments. Submissions that do not meet specifications will be returned to the student for revision and resubmission.

### Evaluation

Assessment / evaluation | Value
--- | ---
Tests (2 are planned) | 30% 
Programming assignments (2 are planned), group/team | 40%
Programming assignment, individual | 30%

In the last week of the course, the student will present their individual programming assignment work to the professor and to invited members of the School of SDDS community, and perhaps interested external parties. 

This course does not have a final examination. 

(FYI... the following was written by Nour, and he was prepared to do it; we should probably check whether Rania wants to do it...) 

This course includes group/team work, and these are the guidelines and procedures:
*	A team has betwen 2 and 5 students. 
*	The team will be selected by the professor and would be announced in the first class. 
*	Each team will select a team leader before the end of the first week of classes.
* ?	Each team member will have to maintain a log (or journal or diary). The log  will contain meeting minutes and week by week work evaluation of other members in terms of their involvements and delivery. Students will have to submit the log at the end of the term.
* ? Members weekly work responsibly must be recorded into a work distribution form. This work distribution form must be signed by all of the team members.  The team leader will keep the signed work distribution form. All the meeting would be headed by the team leader excluding the team meeting in the lab-hour. This meeting would be co-supervised by the team leader and supervised by the professor.
