**Welcome**

This is the website for Peter McIntyre. I study and teach programming that uses web technologies, for both apps and services. I also teach iOS mobile app programming.

In the Fall 2019 term, I am teaching iOS mobile app programming.

In addition to being a professor, I am also the BSD Program Coordinator. BSD is the Bachelor of Technology (Software Development) program that we started in September 2003. Whether youâ€™re a student, faculty, administrator, or an interested community member, feel free to get me involved in any BSD program issue.

Do you have a request? Send me email. I can probably handle your request that way. You can also request an appointment, or contact Joel Colesberry (the BSD program's student advisor).
